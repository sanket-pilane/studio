#### Slide 2: Introduction - The Problem & The Solution

**(Script):**
"Good morning/afternoon, everyone. As electric vehicles become more common, the challenge of finding a convenient and available charging station grows. Drivers often face uncertainty: Is a station occupied? Is it compatible with my car? Is there a better option nearby?

This is the problem ChargeSpot Navigator solves. It's a smart, modern web application designed to help EV drivers find the perfect charging station with confidence and ease."

#### Slide 3: Core Features

**(Script):**
"ChargeSpot Navigator is built around a few core features to create a seamless experience:

1.  **Interactive Map:** At its heart is a fast, responsive map powered by Google Maps, showing all nearby charging stations.
2.  **AI Station Finder:** This is our standout feature. Using Genkit, Google's generative AI toolkit, our AI assistant recommends the best station based on the user's location, desired time, and connector type.
3.  **Real-Time Data & Booking:** Users can see live availability and book a charging slot directly, eliminating uncertainty.
4.  **User Authentication & Profiles:** Secure user accounts are managed by Firebase Authentication, and users can view their booking history in their profile.
5.  **Admin Dashboard:** We also have a complete dashboard for station operators to manage their locations in real-time."

#### Slide 4: Technology Stack - The Foundation

**(Script):**
"To build this, we used a cutting-edge, integrated tech stack.

*   **Framework:** **Next.js** with the App Router. This gives us the power of React with server-side rendering for fast performance and great SEO.
*   **UI:** A combination of **ShadCN/UI** for pre-built, accessible components and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, custom styling. This creates a modern and clean look.
*   **Mapping:** The **Google Maps Platform** is used for all mapping, markers, and directions.
*   **Database & Auth:** **Firebase** is the backbone of our backend. We use **Firestore** as our real-time NoSQL database for stations and bookings, and **Firebase Authentication** for secure user management."

#### Slide 5: The "Magic" - Generative AI with Genkit

**(Script):**
"The AI Station Finder is powered by **Genkit**, a new open-source framework from Google for building AI-powered features.

Here's how it works:
1.  The user provides their requirements: desired time and connector type.
2.  The app sends this, along with the user's location and a list of all available stations from our Firestore database, to a Genkit 'flow'.
3.  This flow runs a prompt on a Large Language Model (LLM) like Gemini.
4.  The prompt asks the AI to act as an expert recommender, analyzing all the data—distance, current availability, time, and ratings—to determine the single best option.
5.  The AI returns not just the station name, but also a user-friendly reason for its choice, which we display to the user.

This turns a simple data lookup into a personalized, intelligent recommendation."

#### Slide 6: Application Architecture

**(Script):**
"Let's look at how it all fits together.

*   **Frontend (The Browser):** The user interacts with our **Next.js/React** application. Components built with **ShadCN/UI** and styled with **Tailwind CSS** make up the interface.
*   **Backend (The Cloud):**
    *   **Firebase** handles all our data. User actions like logging in, booking a spot, or updating a profile directly interact with Firebase Auth and Firestore.
    *   **Genkit Flows**, which are server-side TypeScript functions, contain our AI logic. When the user requests an AI recommendation, the Next.js frontend calls these flows.
*   **AI (The Model):** The Genkit flow communicates with the **Gemini model** via an API, sending the structured prompt and receiving the formatted recommendation.

This architecture is robust, scalable, and allows us to seamlessly integrate powerful AI features directly into our web application."

#### Slide 7: Conclusion & Q&A

**(Script):**
"In summary, ChargeSpot Navigator is more than just a map. It's an intelligent assistant for EV drivers, built on a modern, powerful, and integrated technology stack. By combining Next.js, Firebase, and Genkit, we've created a user-friendly application that solves a real-world problem.

Thank you. I'm now happy to answer any questions you may have."
